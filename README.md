# hello-world

Hello everyone!

I am student at New York Institiute of Technology.
I'm currently in my senior year in a BS program for Computer Science with a focus on Big Data Management.
I have experience in Java and Python. I have some experience with Java Web App development using HTML, JSTL, and Java Script
with a MySQL database.
I also have limited experience with C and C++.

I'm currently working to expand my knowledge of different operating frameworks such as Spring and Struts, and intend to begin learning
additional languages including GoLang, C#, and R. I also would like to get started with Apache Hadoop as I will be taking classes using it
beginning next semester (Spring 2017)
